    <h1>Some features of HTML5 </h1>

    <p>1) Intro of audio and video: <br>
        Audio and Video tags are the two major addition to HTML5. It allows developers to embed a video or audio on
        their website. HTML5 video can use CSS and CSS3 to style the video tag. You can change the border, opacity,
        reflections, gradients, transitions, transformations, and even animations. HTML5 makes adding video super-fast
        and without having to build a video player. This saves time for the developer and offers the client a superior
        and more affordable solution.</p>

    <p>2)Vector Graphics: <br>
        This is a new addition to the revised version which has hugely impacted the use of Adobe Flash in websites. It
        can be used to draw graphics with various shapes and colors via scripting usually JS. Vector graphics are
        scalable, easy to create and edit. It also supports interactivity and animation. Having a smaller file size
        makes transferring and loading graphics much faster on the web. Thatâ€™s the reason why many people prefer to use
        vector graphics.
    </p>
    <P>3)Header and Footer:
        With these new tags, there is no longer a need to identify the two elements with a
    <div> tag. Footer is placed at the end of the web page while Header is placed at the start of the web page. By using
        <header> and <footer> HTML5 elements, the browser will know what to load first and what to load later. <br>
<br>
                The header can contain- <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>One or more heading elements ((h1),(h6)) <br></li>
                    <li> Logo or icon <br></li>
                    <li>Authorship information <br></li>
                    <li>Footer can contain- <br></li>
                </ul>
                Footer can contain-</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Authorship information <br></li>
                    <li>opyright information <br></li>
                    <li>Contact information <br></li>
                    <li>Back to top links</li>
                </ul>
                <p>4)HTML figure and figcaption Elements
                    <br>
                    The figure tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
                        <br>
                    
                    The figcaption tag defines a caption for a figure element. The figcaption element can be placed as the first or as the last child of a figure element.<br>
                    
                    The img element defines the actual image/illustration. <br>
                    </p>
                <P>5)HTML aside Element <br>
                    The aside element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).
                    <br>
                    The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.</P>
