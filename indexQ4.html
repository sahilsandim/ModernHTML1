    <H1>Three Way which can help to make more Website more Accessible</H1>
     
    <p><h3>1] Add Images with Alt Text </h3><br>
        A picture may be worth a thousand words, but visual elements like images are an accessibility barrier to blind users and those with low vision. <br>
        
        They often have to rely on assistive technologies such as Screen Readers and refreshable Braille Readers. <br>
        
        Screen Readers are software programs that read the text on the screen using a synthesizer or Braille display. <br>
        
        However, neither of these technologies can read images or the text in the images. <br>
        
        So, you need to add Alt Text to describe your images to disabled users. <br>
        
        Make sure to describe the image as clearly as possible. <br> 
        </p>

        <p> <h3>2]Allow Users to Enlarge Font Sizes</h3>
            People with low vision often can’t read small text sizes.
            
            So, they have to use specific font settings when browsing your website.
            
            Offering an alternate style sheet with the ability to enlarge the font size without breaking your page layout should make it easier for them to read your content.
            
            Also, make sure your CTA buttons have a larger font size.
            
            Also, make these buttons visible to people with impaired vision.
            
            
        
                <p><h3>4] Add Keyboard Navigation </h3>
                    For blind and visually impaired users, navigation is a challenge.
                    
                    As they can’t use a mouse to browse the site, you have to incorporate keyboard navigation into your website.
                    
                    Blind users will use Braille keyboards to access your site.
                    
                    Make sure disabled users can access all interactive elements of your website, including:
                    
                    URLs.
                    Anchor text.
                    Drop-down menus.
                    Widgets.
                    Forms.
                    CTAs.
                    Dialog boxes.
